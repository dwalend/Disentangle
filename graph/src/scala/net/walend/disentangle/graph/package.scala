/**
 * Representations of various kinds of graphs. The top level, Graph, holds a Set of Nodes and a
 * second collection of things that relate the nodes to each other -- the edges. Subtraits add features to these, and
 * concrete implementations fill in with code tuned to particular uses.
 *
 * Where possible, I use definitions from Wikipedia -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(mathematics)
 *
 * I've left room in the hierarchy for a variety of kinds of graphs, but have only created the concrete classes I have
 * real reasons to use. Please let me know if you need something specific.
