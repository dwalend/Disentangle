Prim's MST algorithm

Put all the verticies in a priority queue with variable key values
Initialize all the keys to O.
Pick the root and set its key to I.
While the queue is not empty
    extract the minimum edge and node
        if the node isn't in the MST
            for each node reachable from it not currently in the MST
                if some node is closer by using this node
                    replace the key with the closer value
